## How I worked on this project

I made this project using NextJS and Typescript using concepts I learned from the Odin Project and my personal explorations of NextJS. First I looked for a suitable weather API and then after finding a mockup design for a weather site I set out to make the basic functionality for searching cities by name, converting those city names into geographic coordinates, and fetching the weather data for the location for current, hourly, and daily formats.

## Why I built the project this way

I decided to make a weather app using NextJS and Typescript in order to produce something useful and practice manipulating and displaying data using those tools.

## Struggles I had to overcome

I had to do quite a bit of gymnastics with the weather API I chose in order to convert location names into lat/lon coordinates and coupling those together. The project also presented quite a few learning experiences for managing types in typescript when fetching datasets from an external API.

## If I had more time I would change this

I would probably refactor the project using a different API due to the aformentioned reasons. Going forward I've learned to more carefully inspect that API that I've chosen before I get too entangled with it.
I'm not a design prodigy so I went with a simple minimalistic design for this site that was based off of a mockup that I found. This was more of an exercise in API data manipulation and display rather than design, but it would be nice to spend more time refining the design.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory you can run:

npm run dev
