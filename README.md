## How I worked on this project

## Why I built the project this way

I decided to make a weather app using NextJS and Typescript in order to produce something useful and practice manipulating and displaying data.

## Struggles I had to overcome

## If I had more time I would change this

I would probably refactor the project using a different API, I had to do quite a bit of gymnastics with the weather API I chose in order to convert location names into lat/lon coordinates and coupling those together. Going forward I've learned to more carefully inspect that API that I've chosen before I get too entangled with it.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory you can run:

npm run dev
