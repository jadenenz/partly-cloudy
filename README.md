## How I worked on this project

I made this project using NextJS and Typescript using concepts I learned from the Odin Project and my personal explorations of NextJS.

## Why I built the project this way

I decided to make a weather app using NextJS and Typescript in order to produce something useful and practice manipulating and displaying data using those tools.

## Struggles I had to overcome

I had to do quite a bit of gymnastics with the weather API I chose in order to convert location names into lat/lon coordinates and coupling those together.

## If I had more time I would change this

I would probably refactor the project using a different API due to the aformentioned reasons. Going forward I've learned to more carefully inspect that API that I've chosen before I get too entangled with it.
I'm not a design prodigy so I went with a simple minimalistic design for this site that was based off of a mockup that I found. This was more of an exercise in API data manipulation and display rather than design, but it would be nice to spend more time refining the design.

## Available Scripts
